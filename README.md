# slackware-stuff

This is where I keep the SlackBuild scripts I maintain (for https://slackbuilds.org/) and any other stuff related with Slackware. Some of the slackbuilds archived here are no longer in SBo, they may no longer work with modern versions of Slackware, YMMV.

The folder *packages* contains already built packages for Slackware64 14.2, which can be installed 
with installpkg or upgradepkg.
