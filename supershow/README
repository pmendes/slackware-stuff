SuperShow - create narrated videos from slideshows

SuperShow can take your slides (exported to PDF) and your audio/video 
recording, and mix them in a single, small size, Adobe Flash file, which can 
be played from the net or downloaded to be seen locally. SuperShow allows you 
to easily sincronize the audio and the slide transitions and insulates you 
from the complexity of creating Flash files from Linux with SWFtools

Requires SWFTools
