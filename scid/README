With Scid you can maintain a database of chess games, search games by
many criteria, view graphical trends, and produce printable reports
on players and openings. There are many more features as well. With
Scid you can also play against various engines or on Internet (FICS).

To enjoy Scid at its full power, you should download these files:
The Player Information / spellcheck data:
  <http://downloads.sourceforge.net/scid/ratings1025.zip>
Photo data:
  <http://downloads.sourceforge.net/scid/Player_photos.zip>
Scidlet opening books:
  <http://downloads.sourceforge.net/scid/scidlet40k.zip>
Place them in the same directory of the source and the will be included
in the package. 

Please see the manpage (man scid) for Slackware-specific information
regarding the opening books permissions.

Optional dependencies (for sound, advanced graphics and correspondence
chess): tDOM, the Img package (tkimg) and Snack sound package. These
packages are *not* required for the build and are searched and loaded
when the program starts. If not found, Scid simply disables these
features.
