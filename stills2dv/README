An open source solution to make a movie out of still pictures, 
stills can be of any resolution (highest preferably for best 
results). The output also could be of any resolution, from a 
small video for youtube to a full HD (or more if you know what 
you're doing). Since we now can make JPGs for ffmpeg and 
mencoder as well as PPMs for encodedv this application could 
also be called; stills2mpeg 

To encode the movies you need encodedv (part of libdv, available 
through SlackBuilds.org) for DV (standard definition only) or 
mencoder (part of mplayer, part of Slackware 13) for mpeg2, 
mpeg4, etc... (standard or high definition) or ffmpeg (available
in SlackBuilds.org) for mpeg2, mpeg4, etc... (standard or high 
definition)
