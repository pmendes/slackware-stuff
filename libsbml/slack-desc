# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libsbml: 
libsbml: libsbml is a free, open-source programming library to help you read, 
libsbml: write, manipulate, translate, and validate SBML files and data 
libsbml: streams. It is not an application itself (though it does come with 
libsbml: example programs), but rather a library you can embed in your own 
libsbml: applications.
