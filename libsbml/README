libsbml is a free, open-source programming library to help you read, 
write, manipulate, translate, and validate SBML files and data 
streams. It is not an application itself (though it does come with 
example programs), but rather a library you can embed in your own 
applications. 

libsbml understands all Levels and Versions of SBML, and supports 
plug-in extensions for SBML Level 3 packages. LibSBML is written in 
ISO C and C++.
