#
# NOTE 1: Crafty uses short notation, so short notation is
# announced. For long notation announcements the crafty engine has
# to be hacked and pgn output as well as logging would get broken.
#
# NOTE 2: There has to exist a sound file named for each row,
# column and piece. That is there has to be sound files like a.wav,
# 1.wav, R.wav and so on. One can easily rename the files
# distributed for free eg. at the "Arena" Website
# (http://www.playwitharena.com). Soundfiles from Fritz are not
# suitable, at the moment, but the script can easily be rewritten
# to handle them as well.
