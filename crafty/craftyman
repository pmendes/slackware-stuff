.SH NAME
crafty \- chess engine
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B crafty
.SH DESCRIPTION
Crafty is a free, open source computer chess program written by Prof. Robert Hyatt. It is derived from Cray Blitz, and it pioneered the use of rotated bitboard data structures to represent the chess board. Crafty can be used as a chess engine by eboard and xboard or it can be used directly on the command line to play or analyze games. It can
use the free syzygy endgame tablebases, if available. Crafty is no longer under development, this is the last version available.

.SH OPTIONS
Crafty does not take any specific command line options, however it will process any arguments present in the command line as if they were commands on the terminal. A thorough explanation of Crafty's terminal commands can be found in
.B /usr/doc/crafty

Crafty can be configured for a stronger game by setting some optional parameters (examples below).  These parameters can be put into the
.B .craftyrc
file, or used as start-up parameters from the terminal.

Library of games used by crafty in openings. A pre-loaded template exists in
.B /usr/share/crafty/book.bin
which can be copied to a user's writeable location (see

environment variable). This file is not mandatory, but if it is absent Crafty will play without a library of openings and will compute moves from the start.

Extensive documentation for version 18 can be found in

, listing all the commands that crafty can process.

See https://chess.massimilianogoi.com/download/tablebases/ for information about the syzygy endgame tables and download links.

.SH BUGS
Issuing the command
.B help
through the command line (as in
.B crafty help
) displays the first page of help and then crashes. However if the command is issued after starting the program, it works without errors.

This is legacy software that is no longer developed, therefore there is no expectation that bugs will be fixed.
