Crafty is a chess program written by professor Robert Hyatt, with
development and assistance from Michael Byrne, Tracy Riegle, and
Peter Skinner. It is derived from Cray Blitz, winner of the 1983
and 1986 World Computer Chess Championships. Tord Romstad,
co-author of Stockfish, described Crafty as "arguably the most
important and influential chess program ever".

Crafty can be used as a chess engine by eboard and xboard.

Crafty uses a library of games book.bin that is extended as it
plays, so each user must have their own copy of this file. The
original is located in /usr/share/crafty-25.2/book.bin. It is
suggested that each user create a folder ~/.crafty and copy the
file to that folder:
 mkdir ~/.crafty && cp /usr/share/crafty-25.2/book.bin ~/.crafty
then set this environment variable to point there:
 export CRAFTY_BOOK_PATH=~/.crafty
It is also useful to set:
 export CRAFTY_LOG_PATH=~/.crafty
 export CRAFTY_RC_PATH=~/.crafty

Crafty can use the syzygy endgame tables (both WDL and DTC), see
https://chess.massimilianogoi.com/download/tablebases/ for
practical information. There is a link there to download the
3-4-5 set from a single zip file (around 1 Gb). These should be
unzipped to a folder in an SSD (or solid state USB drive) and
pointed to by the CRAFTY_TB_PATH environment variable. For
example:
  mkdir /opt/syzygy
  cd /opt/syzygy
  unzip /tmp/3-4-5_pieces_Syzygy.zip
  export CRAFTY_TB_PATH=/opt/syzygy/3-4-5

Crafty's operation.
