At the time of creation of this slackpackage (Dec 7, 2023) audria was
only available as a github repository without a release pacakge. To
keep reproducibility I downloaded the repository as a tar.gz and this
is used here as the source. This was carried out with:

wget https://github.com/scaidermern/audria/tarball/master -o audria.tar.gz
