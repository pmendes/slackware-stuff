# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

audria: audria (A Utility for Detailed Resource Inspection of Applications)
audria:
audria: audria reads various program statistics from the /proc filesystem,
audria: including: current and average CPU usage, virtual memory usage, IO
audria: load, time spent in user/system mode, page faults. audria can be used
audria: to monitor a single process, a group of processes or all currently
audria: running processes. Furthermore it is possible to specify a command to
audria: execute in order to watch a process directly from startup. In
audria: contrast to some other tools, audria is designed to run in batch mode
audria: at very short intervals. This allows very detailed inspections of the
audria: resource usage of a process.
