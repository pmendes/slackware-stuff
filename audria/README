audria is a little tool designed to read various program statistics
from the /proc filesystem, including:
 - current and average CPU usage
 - virtual memory usage (peak, resident set, swap etc.)
 - IO load (current/total read/writes with and without buffers)
 - time spent in user/system mode
 - page faults
 - and other information

audria can be used to monitor a single process, a group of processes
or all currently running processes. Furthermore it is possible to
specify a command to execute in order to watch a process directly
from startup. In contrast to some other tools, audria is designed to
run in batch mode at very short intervals. This allows very detailed
inspections of the resource usage of a process.
