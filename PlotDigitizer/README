Plot Digitizer is a Java program used to digitize scanned plots of functional 
data. Often data is found presented in reports and references as functional X-Y 
type scatter or line plots. In order to use this data, it must somehow be 
digitized. This program will allow you to take a scanned image of a plot (in 
GIF, JPEG, or PNG format)  and quickly digitize values off the plot just by 
clicking the mouse on  each data point. The numbers can then be saved to a text 
file and used where ever you need them. Plot Digitizer works with both linear 
and logarithmic axis scales. Besides digitizing points off of data plots, this  
program can be used to digitize other types of scanned data (such as  scaled 
drawings or orthographic photos).

This requires java. autotrace is optional, but recommended if you want the
auto-digitize feature.
