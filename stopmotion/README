Stopmotion is a program to create stop motion animation movies. The users 
will be able to create stop-motions from pictures imported from a camera 
or from the harddrive, add sound effects and export the animation to 
different video formats such as mpeg or avi. 

Stopmotion build requires libtar (available in SlackBuilds.org).

Stopmotion usage depends on several external programs: 
 - dvgrab for capturing images from DV cameras (available in SlackBuilds.org)
 - vgrabbj for capturing images from v4l1 devices
 - ImageMagik for capturing images from v4l2 devices (included in Slackware 13)
 - ffmpeg for video encoding (available in SlackBuilds.org)
 - mencode for video encoding (available in SlackBuilds.org in the 
   mplayer package)
